          KDexPageArchetype is the Schema for the kdexpagearchetypes API

          A KDexPageArchetype defines a reusable archetype from which web pages can be derived. When creating a KDexPageBinding
          (i.e. a web page) a developer states which archetype is to be used. This allows the structure to be decoupled from
          the content.
