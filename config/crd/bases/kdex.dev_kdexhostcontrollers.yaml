          KDexHostController is the Schema for the kdexhostcontrollers API

          A KDexHostController is the resource used to instantiate and manage a unique controller focused on a single KDexHost
          resource. This focused controller serves to aggregate the host specific resources, primarily KDexPageBindings but
          also as the main web server handling page rendering and page serving. In order to isolate the resources consumed by
          those operations from other hosts a unique controller is necessary. This resource is internally generated and managed
          and not meant for end users.
