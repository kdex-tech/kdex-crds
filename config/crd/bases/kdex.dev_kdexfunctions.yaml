          KDexFunction is the Schema for the kdexfunctions API.

          KDexFunction is a facility to express a particularly concise unit of logic that scales in isolation.
          Ideally these are utilized via a FaaS layer, but for simplicity, some scenarios are modeled by the
          Backend type using containers (native Kubernetes workloads).

                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Ready": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
