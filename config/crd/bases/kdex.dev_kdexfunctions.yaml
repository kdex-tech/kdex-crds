          KDexFunction is the Schema for the kdexfunctions API.

          KDexFunction is a facility to express a particularly concise unit of logic that scales in isolation.
          Ideally these are utilized via a FaaS layer, but for simplicity, some scenarios are modeled by the
          Backend type using containers (native Kubernetes workloads).
