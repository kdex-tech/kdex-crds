# kdex-crds

This project contains a set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for managing micro-frontend applications in Kubernetes.

The architecture of the KDEX App Server's micro-frontend pages follows Semantic HTML as described in [MDN's Structuring documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_documents).

e.g.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- App Server managed head contents; css, meta, scripts & importmap -->
    <title>
      <!-- The title of the page derived from MicroFrontEndAppBinding CR `spec.label` -->
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Renders a MicroFrontEndPageHeader CR -->
    </header>
    <nav>
      <!-- Renders a hierarchical menu containing links to pages derived from MicroFrontEndAppBinding CR `spec.parent` + `spec.label` + `spec.path` -->
    </nav>
    <main>
      <!-- Renders MicroFrontEndApp custom elements -->
      <aside>
        <!-- TODO: CRD -->
      </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <!-- Renders a MicroFrontEndPageFooter CR -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Description

The `kdex-crds` project provides the following CRDs:

- `MicroFrontEndApp`: Represents a micro-frontend application, including its source code and the custom elements it exposes.


These CRDs work together to provide a flexible and declarative way to manage micro-frontends in a Kubernetes environment.

### MicroFrontEndApp

A `MicroFrontEndApp` resource defines a micro-frontend application. Here is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kdex.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MicroFrontEndApp
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  source:
    url: "https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git"
  customElements:
    - name: "my-element"
      description: "A custom element"
```

**Spec Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `customElements` | `[]CustomElement` | A list of custom elements exposed by the micro-frontend application. | No |
| `source` | `MicroFrontEndAppSource` | Defines the source of the micro-frontend application. | Yes |

**CustomElement Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `description` | `string` | Description of the custom element. | No |
| `name` | `string` | Name of the custom element. | Yes |

**MicroFrontEndAppSource Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `secretRef` | `*corev1.LocalObjectReference` | A reference to a secret containing authentication credentials for the source. | No |
| `url` | `string` | URL of the application source. This can be a Git repository, an archive, or an OCI artifact. | Yes |

**Status Fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `conditions` | `[]metav1.Condition` | Represents the current state of the MicroFrontEndApp resource. |



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.24.5+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/kdex-crds:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/kdex-crds:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following the options to release and provide this solution to the users.

### By providing a bundle with all YAML files

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/kdex-crds:tag
```

**NOTE:** The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without its
dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run 'kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE>' to install
the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/kdex-crds/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

### By providing a Helm Chart

1. Build the chart using the optional helm plugin

```sh
kubebuilder edit --plugins=helm/v1-alpha
```

2. See that a chart was generated under 'dist/chart', and users
can obtain this solution from there.

**NOTE:** If you change the project, you need to update the Helm Chart
using the same command above to sync the latest changes. Furthermore,
if you create webhooks, you need to use the above command with
the '--force' flag and manually ensure that any custom configuration
previously added to 'dist/chart/values.yaml' or 'dist/chart/manager/manager.yaml'
is manually re-applied afterwards.
